## How Monitoring Works

When monitoring is enabled:

1. The app starts a foreground background service.
2. The service periodically checks the E-Student portal.
3. Newly detected grades trigger a notification.
4. Monitoring continues even when the application is closed.

### Notes

* Monitoring intervals are not guaranteed to be exact.
* Android battery optimization may delay checks.
* Some manufacturers (Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, etc.) may apply additional background restrictions.
